Problem:  You have been asked to write a computer program for a entertainment center. They have sell their tickets at two separate  prices.  Tickets are $10 a piece except for their "early bird" movies which cost only $5 a ticket.   At the entertainment center they offer all patrons dinner along with the movie.  The cost of dinner is $8 during the week and $12 during the weekend.   All customers must pay for both dinner and the movie.   At the end of the order a receipt is printed showing:  Number of Tickets, price per ticket, price per dinner, cost of dinner and meal, total amount owed.

test data:  5 tickets, early bird, weekday
Price per ticket: $5
Price per dinner:  $8
Price per dinner and meal:  $13
Total Amount Owed:  $65

10 tickets, evening ticket, weekend
Price per ticket: $10
Price per dinner:  $12
Price per dinner and meal:  $22
Total Amount Owed:  $220

Assumptions:
dinner and movie for each
only two movie prices
only two dinner prices
no additional fees

regular Ticket = 10
earlybird Ticket = 5
weekday Dinner = 8
weekend Dinner = 12

Input:
number of Tickets
ticket Type
dinner Type

Calculations:

if ticket Type = "regular" then
     ticket Rate = regular Ticket
else
     ticket Rate = earlybird Ticket
if dinner Type = "weekday" then
     dinner Rate = weekday Dinner
else
     dinner Rate = weekend Dinner

total Ticket and Dinner = ticket Rate + dinner Rate
total Amount = total ticket Dinner * number Tickets

Output:
number of Tickets
ticket Rate
dinner Rate
total Ticket and Dinner
total Amount
