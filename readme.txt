This is a basic JavaScript logic problem. 

Problem:  You have been asked to write a computer program for a entertainment center. They have sell their tickets at two separate  prices.  Tickets are $10 a piece except for their "early bird" movies which cost only $5 a ticket.   At the entertainment center they offer all patrons dinner along with the movie.  The cost of dinner is $8 during the week and $12 during the weekend.   All customers must pay for both dinner and the movie.   At the end of the order a receipt is printed showing:  Number of Tickets, price per ticket, price per dinner, cost of dinner and meal, total amount owed.
